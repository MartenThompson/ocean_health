## Ocean Health Index

*An index to assess the health and benefits
of the global ocean*, Halpern et al. 2012.

Introduces a numerical index representing the health of the world's coastal waters from an expressly human-centric perspective. The Ocean Health Index (OHI) is comprised of scores from ten subcategories: 



In my opinion, its strengths include: establishing a common vocabulary to discuss ocean health amongst conservationists, policy makers, and the public, consistent results affords numerical analysis. However, it has drawbacks such: not actually concerning the oceans (only coastal waters) thus limiting applicability and confusing consumers, and "health" is to be understood as an economic term first and ecological term second. Also, the index is complex and I'm unsure how valuable it would be to policy makers. However it might read, the Ocean Health Index is a measure of coast waters' economic value. 

Not that this is a bad thing, just that I wish it was [better named](https://www.karlton.org/2017/12/naming-things-hard/). And I'm in favor of an index that respects the fact that humans are part of ocean ecosystems, not a force external to them. 

Their stated goals 

> We addressed six major challenges 
>  1. identify a modest
number of widely accepted goals to assess ocean health and benefits at
> 2. develop models that measure, with reasonable accuracy,
how well each goal is achieved; 
> 3. define robust reference points for
each model; 
> 4. incorporate sustainability into the index;
> 5.  ensure
that the index is responsive to real differences and changes in ocean
health and benefits; and 
> 6. allow flexibility to adapt to constraints (or
future improvements) of data availability, quality and quantity.




### Questions

1. how well did they do oin their 6 goals? 
1. is it really measuring ocean health if covid can knock it back? (assuming my hypothesis is correct)
1. different weightings? 
1. is inference even possible on this index, or would it just back out the definition of itself? 
1. "As with any indicator, the index assesses
rather than models current and future conditions, and so it cannot
predict the future. However, it can be used to simulate the consequences of a range of potential actions, providing a powerful tool
to inform decisions about how to use or protect ocean ecosystems." p618. I think it does model. Also, simulate how, by recalculating it? Can I get my hands on the express definition?
